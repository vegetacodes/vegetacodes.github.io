I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Lead Developer at MathWorks Inc., specializing in crafting web apps, RESTful APIs and Consumers using Ruby, Python, Java & Go. I excel in Service-Oriented Architecture and designing systems for seamless integration with platforms like Adobe Experience Manager, SalesForce and microservices.

With over 10 years of experience, I've led successful projects for MathWorks' [Training e-commerce](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/training/classroom-courses.html?q=&page=1), [Bug Reports](https://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/?s_tid=hc_resources) and [Careers](https://www.mathworks.com/company/jobs/opportunities.html?s_tid=hp_ff_a_careers) applications, contributing to $65 million in annual revenue. I'm known for architecting scalable systems and streamlining the localization process for international users.

I have expertise in SOLR-based backend search, optimizing data storage with Memcached, and designing data purging systems to comply with data privacy laws like GDPR. My technical skills span Ruby, Python, C#, Java, Go, JavaScript and various frameworks and tools, and I actively contribute to open-source projects.

I'm passionate about delivering exceptional results and making a real impact in the software development world. Let's collaborate and create something amazing!

When I'm not working, you can find me kayaking, rowing on [Charles River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_River).
