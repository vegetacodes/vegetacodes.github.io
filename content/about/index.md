I am an Engineering Manager at [AutoGrid](https://auto-grid.com) (Schneider Electric), leading a team of developers dedicated to transforming the Energy Sector through AI solutions. My specialization lies in the design and development of applications, APIs, and microservices in distributed systems architecture.

With more than a decade of experience, I have successfully overseen projects for MathWorks' [Training e-commerce](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/training/classroom-courses.html?q=&page=1), [Bug Reports](https://www.mathworks.com/support/bugreports/?s_tid=hc_resources), and [Careers](https://www.mathworks.com/company/jobs/opportunities.html?s_tid=hp_ff_a_careers) applications, contributing significantly to an annual revenue of $65 million. My reputation stems from my adeptness in crafting scalable systems utilizing a Service-Oriented Architecture, as well as my role in streamlining the localization process for international users.

My expertise encompasses SOLR-based backend search, optimization of data storage using Memcached, and the creation of data purging systems to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR. I possess technical proficiency in a wide range of languages including Ruby, Python, C#, Java, Go, and JavaScript, along with various frameworks and tools. Additionally, I actively engage in contributing to open-source projects.

My enthusiasm centers around delivering exceptional outcomes and effecting tangible change in the realm of software development. I am eager to collaborate and bring forth something truly remarkable!

Outside of work, you can find me kayaking and rowing along the [Charles River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_River).
